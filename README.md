# server

This small script is a part of my script collection for saving my time while playing CTF, Pentest engagment or any exam.
This script saved my time instead of typing python3 -m http.server time and again now I can just simply type "server" and it will by default listen on port 9001 if I type "server 1337" it will listen on port 1337.

Note: Just make it executable with chmod and place this bash file in /usr/bin/ or /usr/share/bin/

Usage: server or server 1234 and it will listen to that port.

I hope this saves your time too and you like it :)
